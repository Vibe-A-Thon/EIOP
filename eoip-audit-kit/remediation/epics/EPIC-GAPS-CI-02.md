# EPIC-GAPS-CI-02: EOIP-engg-doc-pkg/gaps-requirements.md · needs_ci_l3

*Passing mapped tests (L2); needs a same-commit green L3 CI run (or L4) to close.* 60 tasks, ~30.0 h, priorities {'P2': 60}. Audited commit `3ed3acd50e47ab8867aa6885d202f9956358dc3a`.

**How to work this epic:** claim it (remediation/README.md §2), then take tasks top-down (sorted by priority). For each: do the next steps, write tests for the acceptance criteria, produce evidence items, release the lock.

**Next steps**
1. Depends on FT-F04 (real CI on dev_local). After it lands: confirm the mapped tests run in an L3-eligible workflow (validation-evidence.yml, ci.yml)
2. Review that the passing tests actually assert the requirement (spot-check against acceptance criteria below); add missing assertions
3. Record the green run id as L3 on the same commit as the L2 run

**Acceptance criteria**
- [ ] Statement holds (verbatim requirement is the criterion): Enforce source-level data policies.
- [ ] At least one automated test asserts each criterion above and is mapped to this ID (pytest mark or requirements-test-map.json)
