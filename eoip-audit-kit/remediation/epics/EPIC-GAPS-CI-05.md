# EPIC-GAPS-CI-05: EOIP-engg-doc-pkg/gaps-requirements.md · needs_ci_l3

*Passing mapped tests (L2); needs a same-commit green L3 CI run (or L4) to close.* 39 tasks, ~19.5 h, priorities {'P2': 39}. Audited commit `3ed3acd50e47ab8867aa6885d202f9956358dc3a`.

**How to work this epic:** claim it (remediation/README.md §2), then take tasks top-down (sorted by priority). For each: do the next steps, write tests for the acceptance criteria, produce evidence items, release the lock.

## RT-GAP-SDT-008 [P2] GAP-SDT-008: Support semantic digital-thread comparison between releases

- **Source:** `EOIP-engg-doc-pkg/gaps-requirements.md:388-388` (list_item) · **Type:** Functional · **Severity:** Medium
- **Now:** Partially Implemented / L2 (tests passed 4, failed 0)
- **Gaps:** Passing mapped tests (L2); needs a same-commit green L3 CI run (or L4) to close; No L3: no L3-eligible CI workflow green on the audited commit; No L4 non-prod runtime evidence
- **Depends on:** FT-F04 · **Effort:** 0.5 h (XS, medium confidence)

- **GAP-SDT-008:** Support semantic digital-thread comparison between releases.
```
</details>

**Next steps**
1. Depends on FT-F04 (real CI on dev_local). After it lands: confirm the mapped tests run in an L3-eligible workflow (validation-evidence.yml, ci.yml)
2. Review that the passing tests actually assert the requirement (spot-check against acceptance criteria below); add missing assertions
3. Record the green run id as L3 on the same commit as the L2 run

**Acceptance criteria**
- [ ] Statement holds (verbatim requirement is the criterion): Support semantic digital-thread comparison between releases.
- [ ] At least one automated test asserts each criterion above and is mapped to this ID (pytest mark or requirements-test-map.json)
