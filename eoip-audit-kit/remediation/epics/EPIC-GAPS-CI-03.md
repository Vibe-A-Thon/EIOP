# EPIC-GAPS-CI-03: EOIP-engg-doc-pkg/gaps-requirements.md · needs_ci_l3

*Passing mapped tests (L2); needs a same-commit green L3 CI run (or L4) to close.* 60 tasks, ~30.5 h, priorities {'P2': 60}. Audited commit `3ed3acd50e47ab8867aa6885d202f9956358dc3a`.

**How to work this epic:** claim it (remediation/README.md §2), then take tasks top-down (sorted by priority). For each: do the next steps, write tests for the acceptance criteria, produce evidence items, release the lock.
